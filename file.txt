Free cash flow margins have remained strong despite increasing operational costs in some areas.

The organization’s capital expenditure has been focused on expanding data center infrastructure and AI research.

Despite strong cash flow, net profits have shown a gradual decrease over recent business quarters.

The downward profit trend is primarily attributed to rising development costs, greater investments in research and innovation, and competitive pressures in the advertising sector.
